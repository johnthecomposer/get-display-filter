# get-show-filter
Get data from a server, display it in a table, and filter the results.

current functionality:
- onclick of 'get' button, a GET request is sent to the server defined in get_url
- the data retrieved can be filtered via the search bar (using jQuery autocomplete)
- search bar results can be further refined by clicking the column headers
- alternatively, the results range can be defined with the sliders

to add:
- proportional column widths
- revisit options rather than fixed positions
- responsive layout
- sorting options: drag and drop/in-place
